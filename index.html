<!-- 				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpeg" alt="" /></span> -->
				<p>
					Hey there! I’m Himal Baskota, a dynamic professional with a rich tapestry of experience weaving through software development, data analysis, and risk management. My career journey has equipped me with a unique blend of skills, including stints as a Frontend Developer, .NET Developer, and IT Business Partnership Trainee, each role fueling my passion for technology and innovation.

I thrive on transforming complex data into powerful insights that drive strategic decision-making. Currently, I focus on risk assessment and fraud management, developing and executing efficient algorithms that safeguard organizational integrity. My technical toolkit is brimming with expertise in various Database Management Systems (DBMS), including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. With a mastery of SQL, I design and implement data models that not only ensure data integrity but also enable seamless querying for insightful analysis.

My journey has been driven by a thirst for knowledge and continuous improvement, particularly in big data analytics. I love diving into the depths of data to uncover hidden patterns and trends, empowering organizations to make informed decisions and innovate boldly.

When I’m not buried in code or data, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, collaborating with brilliant minds, or enjoying the great outdoors. I firmly believe in technology's power to drive meaningful change, and I’m always excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts who share this passion.

Let’s connect and explore how we can create impactful solutions together!
